                <h2>Guzheng</h2>
                <p>One of the numerous instruments believed to be indigenous to China, the Guzheng emerged during the Zhou Dynasty. By the 8th century CE, it had 12 or 13 strings of silk, increasing to 16 (ultimately of copper or steel wire) and, from the mid-20th century, to 18 or 21 strings.</p>
                <p>It is a popular multi-stringed zither, with pitch-defining movable bridges under each of its strings. The strings are tuned to a pentatonic scale without half-steps, (do, re, mi, so, la,) over a 3-4 octave range.</p>

                <h2>Pipa</h2>
                <p>The Pipa was introduced to China from central Asia during the Han Dynasty, though the Silk Road over 2,000 years ago. Now, it has become so thoroughly integrated into Chinese music and culture, that it is thought to be traditional.</p> 
                <p>The Pipa is a four-stringed, wooden instrument, with 19-26 frets. The bent-neck Pipa, was originally plucked with a large plectrum, but a more advanced five-finger plucking is employed now. The variety of techniques used to play the Pipa makes it one of the most expressive instruments played in China. </p>
